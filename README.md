# Docker Friend 


#DEVELOPMENT MODE
Everyone needs a friend. 
When it comes to docker, it's nice to have a nice UI where you can have access to your containers, and can also inject temporary AWS credentials.


If you haven't already done so, you'll need to install the node dependencies in dev mode.

`npm install`

Then you can run

`docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up`
