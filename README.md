# Docker Friend 
Everyone needs a friend. When it comes to docker, it's nice to have a nice UI where you can take action on your containers, cleanup images, and can also inject temporary credentials from AWS directly into your container.

If you haven't already done so, you'll need to install the node dependencies in dev mode.

`npm install`

Then you can run

`docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up`
